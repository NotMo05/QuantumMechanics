# Quantum Mechanics Simulation

This Python project simulates and visualizes quantum mechanical systems, specifically:

- **Non-symmetric Potential Well**: Solves the Schr√∂dinger equation and plots energy levels, wave functions, and probability densities for a particle in a non-symmetric potential well.
- **Finite Potential Barrier**: Solves for a quantum particle encountering a finite potential barrier and plots the real, imaginary, and squared magnitudes of the wave function.

## Features

- Numerical solutions using **Newton-Raphson** method.
- Visualization of wave functions and probability densities using **matplotlib**.
- Ability to handle non-symmetric potentials and finite potential barriers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `scipy` for numerical operations

## Installation
