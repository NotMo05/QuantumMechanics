# QuantumMechanics
Quantum Mechanics simulation in Python. The code numerically solves and visualizes the Schr√∂dinger equation for a non-symmetric potential well and a finite potential barrier, plotting energy levels, wave functions, and probability densities using numerical methods and matplotlib.
